## Hi there 👋
My name is Nathan Czesak and I'm a student at Arizona State University, passionate about software development and building useful tools. I'm studing computer science(BS) with a concentration in software engineering.

🧮Co-created a GPA calculator in Python to help students track their academic performance. Created this in my junior year of high school with one other friend as a school project.

🕹️Co-created this JavaScript maze, inspired by the classic scary maze, without the scary part! I did this in my freshman year of high school with two friends, which was how I first got into coding and game/web development.

🥗A diet tracking app using Android Studio, Kotlin, and XML to promote healthy habits.
I implemented AI into our app by creating a diet-related chatbot using Gemini. I created this app during my senior year of high school in a software engineering class with two other friends. Originally, it was supposed to be a workout app where the user could track their diet and workouts, but we only had time to make the diet side of the app.
