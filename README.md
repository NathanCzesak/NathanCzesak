## Hi there 👋
I’m Nathan Czesak, a Computer Science student at Arizona State University with a concentration in Software Engineering. I’m passionate about developing practical, user-friendly software that solves real problems. Whether I’m building mobile apps, experimenting with AI integration, or creating tools to help students, I love turning ideas into working products that people can use.

🧮 GPA Calculator
In my junior year of high school, I collaborated with a friend to create a GPA calculator using Python. We built this as a class project to help students easily calculate and track their GPA without having to rely on spreadsheets or online tools that lacked customization. The app allows users to enter courses and letter grades to receive an accurate GPA based on standard formulas. This project was my first experience building a utility with a clear user benefit, and it sparked my interest in using code to improve everyday life.

🕹️ JavaScript Maze Game
Back in my freshman year of high school, I teamed up with two friends to create a fun browser-based maze game using JavaScript. It was inspired by the classic scary maze game—but without the jump scare.
We built everything from scratch: the maze layout, player controls, collision detection, and win/lose conditions. It was my introduction to game development and front-end programming, and it taught me how to think logically about design, interaction, and code structure. It was also the first time I saw how coding could be both creative and collaborative.

🥗 Diet Tracking App with AI Chatbot
During my senior year, I worked with two classmates to develop a diet tracking app in Android Studio using Kotlin and XML. The idea was to help users build healthier habits by logging meals and keeping track of their nutrition.
What made this project stand out was the AI integration—I built a chatbot using Gemini that could offer personalized diet tips, answer food-related questions, and help users stay motivated. The original vision included both workout and diet tracking, but we focused on the diet side to make sure it was fully functional and polished.
This was the most ambitious project I had taken on at the time. It pushed me to understand mobile app architecture, user interface design, and the challenges of combining AI with user interaction in a meaningful way.
